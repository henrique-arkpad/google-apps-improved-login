Google Apps Improved Login (GAIL) provides Google Apps administrators with two oft-requested features: the ability to customize the login page and the ability to log in as their users.  GAIL is designed to run on Google's App Engine so that admins do not need to have their own web server.  GAIL works by making use of the SAML Single Sign-On (SSO) Service for Google Apps.  Premier and Education Editions of Google Apps are supported.  Standard Edition is not.

**GAIL is DEPRECATED and is not considered stable or safe for general use.  You use GAIL at your own risk!**
